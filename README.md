# ON Esports Test Task â€“ React + TypeScript + Vite

I implemented a simulation of the Overwolf API and a CS2 game for the test assignment at [ON Esports]. It uses real-time data, including event chat, to display a KDA table of players.

## Tech Stack
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Effector**

## Environment Requirements
- **Node.js version:** 20 or later (recommended: 20.12.1)

## How to Run Locally?
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [repo url/ssh]
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
3. Start the development server:
    ```sh
   npm run dev
4. To build the project, run:
    ```sh
   npm run build


### Implemented Features
- **Real-time event chat** (simulated using Effector state management).
- **Player stats table** displaying **K/D/A**.
- **Interactive UI** with options to show/hide the event chat and player stats table.
